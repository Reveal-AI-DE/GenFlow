The project follows [a successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model),
utilizing several key branches. Among them are:

- `origin/master`: This is the primary branch, where the HEAD always represents a production-ready version of
the source code.

- `origin/develop` This serves as the main branch for ongoing development. The HEAD here reflects the latest
implemented changes intended for the upcoming release. It is often referred to as the "integration branch."
