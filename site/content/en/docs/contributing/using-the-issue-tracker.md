The issue tracker is the recommended platform for reporting bugs, requesting features, and submitting pull requests.
However, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Avoid using the issue tracker for personal support inquiries. Instead, consider contacting us.
- Stay on topic and maintain a respectful tone in discussions. Refrain from derailing or trolling issues, and
respect differing viewpoints.
