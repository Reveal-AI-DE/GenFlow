A bug is a clear and reproducible issue caused by the code in the repository. Providing detailed and well-structured
bug reports is greatly appreciated—thank you for your help!

### Guidelines for Bug Reports:

1. **Search for Existing Issues**: Use the GitHub issue search to check if the problem has already been reported.
2. **Verify the Fix**: Ensure the issue hasn’t already been resolved by testing it on the latest `develop` branch.
3. **Isolate the Problem**: Try to narrow down the issue and, if possible, create a minimal test case to demonstrate it.

A good bug report should provide all the necessary details to help others understand and resolve the issue without
needing to follow up for more information. Be as thorough as possible in your report. Include the following:

- **Environment**: Describe your setup (e.g., operating system, browser, etc.).
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide a clear sequence of steps to replicate the issue.
- **Expected Outcome**: Explain what you expected to happen.
- **Actual Outcome**: Describe what actually happened.

### Example Bug Report:

**Title**: Short and descriptive title summarizing the issue.

**Summary**: A brief explanation of the problem, including the browser/OS environment where it occurs. If applicable,
list the steps to reproduce the issue:

1. Step one to reproduce the issue.
2. Step two to reproduce the issue.
3. Additional steps, if necessary.

**Additional Information**: Include any other relevant details, such as specific lines of code causing the issue,
potential solutions, or your thoughts on how to address the problem.
