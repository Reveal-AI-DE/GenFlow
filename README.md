## Telemetry Notice üìä

GenFlow collects domain information using telemetry for analytics purposes. The only data
sent to the telemetry server is the admin domain (e.g., `example.com`). No personal data is ever sent, and no
cookies are included in the response. The GenFlow team uses these domains to track the usage of the platform.

If you prefer to disable telemetry, you can do so by modifying the `genflow-ui/.env.production` file:

```bash
REACT_APP_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
```
