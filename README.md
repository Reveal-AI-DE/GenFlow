**GenFlow** is an open-source, low-code GenAI platform that empowers organizations to build and manage Generative
AI assistants that automate routine writing tasks and enhance access to internal knowledge.

## Designed for flexibility and collaboration, GenFlow enables teams to 🌟:
- Create and deploy custom AI assistants tailored to their workflows.
- Select and configure the language models best suited for their needs.
- Monitor usage patterns and performance through built-in analytics.
- Operate in a team-based environment where each team can maintain its own assistants and dedicated knowledge base.

Whether you're streamlining documentation, automating reports, or enabling internal support bots, GenFlow helps you
harness the power of GenAI — faster, smarter, and with minimal coding.
